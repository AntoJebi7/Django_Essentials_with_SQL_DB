Django templates are typically HTML files with embedded Django Template Language (DTL) tags. These tags are used to 
dynamically generate content that can vary depending on the context provided by views.

for example ,

base.html contains the code that are repeatable or same format codes

index.html and detail.html both have their same navbar and footer tag

center container is the only thing that is keep on changing

to add dynamic content in the center

add template syntax


{%  block content  %}
    // base.html is ready to accept the dynamic content
{% endblock  %}


now remove the content that are in base.html in index.html

header and footer are removed in index.html

so we need to integrate base html to index html to apply the dynamic content

Index.html:

{% extends 'base.html' %}  now we can access block in base.html to index.html
at the top


to use the block in index.html

{% block content %}
    //content
{% endblock %}
 

if we save now and run , we get template does not exist error 
then check the extends path correctly


thus layouts dynamically connected !!!
