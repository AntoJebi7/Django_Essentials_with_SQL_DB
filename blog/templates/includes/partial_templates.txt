create "includes" folder under "templates" folder

create header.html , footer.html in it

cut and paste header codes from base.html to header.html
cut and paste footer codes from base.html to footer.html


now we are going to connect these 2 files to base.html

by using this syntax 

    {% include '/filepath' %}
