<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'blog/style.css' %}">


{% static %}  - static template tag

to make it work 
we need to load the library   {% load static %} should be declared at the top

if we click css file via page source,we get an error ,page not found
because it just build the url ,it doesnt know to configure and connect

so to actually make it work, WE NEED TO TELL THE STATIC FILES ARE LOCATED THERE and django project to recognize

main app --> settings  --> STATIC_URL  -->  STATIC_URL = 'static/' (you can change the static into any string) 

create under STATIC_URL = 'static/'

STATICFILES_DIRS=[
    "blog/static/blog/"   # this means django project recognize there is static files for this project
    # blog app --> static folder --> blog folder --> css files
]


This is the way we can link our css file to the html in django as static files
